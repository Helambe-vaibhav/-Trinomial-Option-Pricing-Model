This README provides an overview of options pricing using the Binomial and Trinomial models. These models are widely used in the field of finance to estimate the value of options. The Binomial model simplifies the movement of an asset price into two possible outcomes, while the Trinomial model expands it to three possible outcomes.

# Binomial Model
The Binomial model is a discrete-time model that assumes an asset's price can either move up or down in each time step. This movement is typically represented using a binomial tree. The model calculates the option price by recursively working backward through the tree, considering both upward and downward movements. The final option price is determined by aggregating discounted future payoffs.

# Trinomial Model
The Trinomial model is an extension of the Binomial model that introduces a third possible outcome for the asset price movement, apart from the upward and downward movements. This extra state accommodates more complex scenarios and adds granularity to the pricing model. Similar to the Binomial model, the Trinomial model employs a tree structure to compute option prices, factoring in three possible asset price movements at each step.

# Usage
To use these models for options pricing, you typically need to provide the following input parameters:

-Current Asset Price (S): The price of the underlying asset at the beginning.
-Strike Price (K): The pre-agreed price at which the option can be exercised.
-Risk-free Rate (r): The interest rate assumed to have no default risk.
-Time to Expiration (T): The time remaining until the option's expiration.
-Price Movement Factors (u and d): Parameters determining the upward and downward movements in the asset's price.
-Number of Steps (n or m): The number of time steps in the Binomial or Trinomial tree.
-Using these parameters, the models calculate the option price based on the chosen option type (call or put) and the specified model (Binomial or Trinomial).

# Conclusion
Both the Binomial and Trinomial models offer valuable insights into options pricing by simulating potential asset price movements over time. They serve as foundational concepts in quantitative finance and are fundamental to more sophisticated models used in derivatives pricing.
